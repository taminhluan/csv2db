Safeguard G,G1. Displacement of emissions,"Actions to reduce displacement of emissions. Displacement is an important issue with regard to REDD+ because there may be no net reduction in emissions if deforestation has simply shifted to another area as a consequence of REDD+ implementation. In order to reduce the risks of displacement, the NRAP and PRAPs identify key drivers of deforestation and degradation, as well as potential opportunities for forest enhancement, and clarify how these drivers are to be addressed by the REDD+ PaMs. Potential social and environmental impacts of the proposed PaMs are to be identified and mitigated, including conflicts linked to land use in REDD+ intervention areas. The NFMS is also expected to be capable of identifying instances of deforestation and forest degradation, which, through further investigation may be shown to be due to displacement as a consequence of REDD+ implementation. NFMS tracking of deforestation and forest degradation, coupled with analysis of causes, can inform actions taken to reduce the risk of any further displacement. In addition, Viet Nam has cross-border collaboration agreements on forest management and trade with neighbouring countries (e.g. Lao PDR and Cambodia), which can help identify and reduce potential regional displacement.",,N/A – no provincial monitoring for this criterion,,,,,,,,,
